## Sample Data

The `seed.sql` file provides realistic insertions to test the schema:

- **3 users**: a host, guest, and admin
- **2 properties**: owned by the host
- **2 bookings**: made by the guest
- **1 payment**: for a confirmed booking
- **1 review**: written by the guest
- **2 messages**: exchanged between guest and host

Each entry includes relevant timestamps and reflects a real-world usage pattern.
